# Are you sick of all that lousy grey in the Wordpress admin?
I sure was, that’s why i built Executive Admin. It’ll make your vigorous Wordpressing much more delightful. 
**Also, it's completely GRATIS! Yep, free!**

It installs just like any other plugin, and can be disabled any time you want. It’s still brand new, so if you find any bugs just use the contact form in the settings page to let me know. Here are a few of the goodies within.

- Integrated one-click automatic updates
- Horizontal drop-down menu for faster access
- Typography optimized for readability & purtiness
- Color highlighting for plugin, post, & page status (see that screenshot right above?)
- Hip as f**k "Wrench Menu" frees up some screen space. And is fully configurable.

I know what you're thinking... "How is such a brilliant & clearly magnificent plugin completely free?" The answer is quite simple: I'm currently putting the finishing touches on my failproof plan for world domination. I just do this Wordpress stuff in my free time.
